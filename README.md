# PasswordGenerator

## Description 
I created the attached program in order to allow users to generate random passwords based on the inputs they contribute to the program. This password can then be used in users accounts for extra security/privacy. I created the program using VS Code, creating a CSS file, an HTML file and a JS file and then uploaded it to github in order to publish it for others to use. 

The password generator can be accessed using the link below:

# Installation 
You can access the password generator using the link above and you can also view and analyzing the underlying code using my github repository which can be found in the link below: 

https://github.com/carolineablynch/PasswordGenerator.git

# Usage 

As seen in the screenshot below, you can click on the "generate password" button and you will be alerted with a series of prompts to specify the parameters of the password you would like to generate that the program will consider in its selection.
